    <h1>Datasets</h1>
    

    <p>The three main datasets used in the paper are <a href="https://github.com/ericmjonas/circuitdata/">available in cleaned-up form
on Github</a>. Here we outline
briefly the origin and preprocessing on the data, although full details and
code are avilable at the github site.</p>
<h3>Mouse Retina</h3>
<p>The original data is from </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Helmstaedter, M., Briggman, K. L., Turaga, S. C., Jain, V., Seung, H. S., &amp; Denk, W. (2013). Connectomic reconstruction of the inner plexiform layer in the mouse retina. Nature, 500(7461), 168–174. doi:10.1038/nature12346] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>which <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v500/n7461/abs/nature12346.html">can be accessed here</a>. Briefly, dense serial electron microscopy of a $114\mu m \times 80 \mu m $ area
in the mouse retina yielded a listing
of places where neurons come into contact. There were over 1000 cells
originally, and selected the 950 for which the location of the soma
could be reconstructed from the provided cell plots (soma locations
were not provided by the study's authors in machine-readable
form). Ultimately this left a matrix between the total synapse-like
contact area between all pairs of 950 cells. Area was thresholded at
0.1um, determined by hand, to yield a 950 x 950 entry
matrix that served as input to our algorithm. We measured the distance
between cells using the reconstructed soma centers. Here, for example, is
the resulting adjacency matrix, with the size of entry in the matrix
proportional to the number of contact points.</p>

<p>And here are the physical location of the cell bodies of each cell,
colored by anatomist-derived cell type, in x-y-z.</p>

<h3>C. Elegans.</h3>
<p>We obtained the connectome of c. elegans from data published
previously \autocite{Varshney2011}, and isolated the 279 nonpharyngeal
neurons, with a total of 6393 chemical synapses and 890 gap junctions
originally cleaned up in \autocite{Chen2006}. A cell's position was
its distance along the anterior-posterior axis normalized between zero
and one. We used both networks, the chemical network as a directed
graph and the electrical network as undirected graph. We use the
synapse counts with the logistic-distance poisson likelihood, scaling
the counts by 4.0 to compensate for the Poisson's overdispersion.</p>
<p>The connectivity of the worm, c. elegans -- blue are chemical synapses, red
are electrical synapses. </p>

<h3>Microprocessor</h3>
<p>The team at <a href="http://visual6502.org/">Visual 6502.org</a> performed a
connectome-like reconstruction of the original <a href="original
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">MOS Technology 6502
8-bit microprocessor</a> and used it to
build <a href="http://visual6502.org/JSSim/index.html">a cycle-accurate transistor-level
simulation</a> We extracted the
connection graph for the transistors from this data. Each transistor
has three terminals (gate, source, drain), but the methods of the
original dataset were unable to consistently resolve which of the C1
and C2 terminals were source and drain, leading to ambiguity in our
encoding. We identified a region consisting of three registers X, Y,
and S via visual inspection and focused our efforts there. We created
a total of six connectivity matrices by examining possible terminal
pairings. </p>
