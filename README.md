Connectivity and attribute motif experiments

Goal: 
Try building a mixture model with additional metadata including: 

location of soma
dendritic arbor shape

Implement NIG in code

Test mixture model 

Extract features from data

run mixture model 

Estimate runtime performance

Add in connectivity



Pipeline:

1. select the data you want
2. Construct the model, pick HP gridding
3. Random init the data
4.
