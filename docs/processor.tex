To show the applicability of our method to other connectome-style
datasets, we obtained the spatial location and interconnectivity of
the transistors in a classic microprocessor, the MOS Technology 6502
(used in the Apple II) \autocite{James2010}. Computer architects use
common patterns of transistors when designing circuits, with each
transistor having a ``type'' in the circuit. We identified a region of
the processor with complex but known structure containing the primary
8-bit registers X, Y, and S (fig~\ref{fig:mos6502}).

Our algorithm identifies areas of spatial homogeneity that mirror the
known structure in the underlying architectural circuit, segmenting
transistor types recognizable to computer architects. Using the
original schematics, we see that one identified type contains the
``clocked'' transistors, which retain digital state. Two other types
contain transistors with pins C1 or C2 connected to ground, mostly
serving as inverters.  An additional identified type controls the
behavior of the three registers of interest (X, Y, and S) with respect
to the SB data bus, either allowing them to latch or drive data from
the bus. The repeat patterns of spatial connectivity are visible in
figure~\ref{fig:mos6502}c, showing the man-made horizontal and
vertical layout of the same types of transistors.

\subsection*{Microprocessor}
We extracted the connection graph for the transistors in the MOS6502
\autocite{visual6502source}. Each transistor has three terminals (gate,
source, drain), but the methods of the original dataset were unable to
consistently resolve which of the C1 and C2 terminals were source and
drain, leading to ambiguity in our encoding. We identified a region
consisting of three registers X, Y, and S via visual
inspection and focused our efforts there. We created a total of six
connectivity matrices by examining possible terminal pairings. One
graph, for example, $R^{gc_1}(e_i, e_j)=1$ if transistor $e_j$ and
$e_j$ are connected via pins $g$ and $c_1$.
