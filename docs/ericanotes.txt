Include secition of processor per the figure 
"We identified a region of processor"

fig 5 do you want a color key


also the fig itself is missing the a and b labels

hmmmm, figures 8 9 10
so first of all, when you reference them in the text they are out of order

The actual clusterings for iSRM, the iSBM, and SBMk=12 are shown in figures 8, 10, and 9 respectively.


so, are some of the bits in those figures supposed to look squished?
like, fig 8, the ones at the bottom
and in fig 9, the bottom of one of the bottom bits is cut off
I think by the page number?
and why does the page number appear above the figure number :-P
answer: Latex


section 4.6, you have the word mu instead of the symbol



ok in section 4.6 (hyperprior grids) it would be useful to reference each paragraph back to the place where you explained that model. I'm just noticing this because I want to check that the variables match.



ok in 4.6 for the logistic distance bernoulli, lambda and mu are described as hyperparameters. in section 3.2 where that model is described, lambda^hp and mu^hp appear once each, but it is not clear (to me) what they are supposed to be, since you described p_max and p_min as per-graph hyperparameters
(but it is more clear based on section 4.6, just pointing this out)
