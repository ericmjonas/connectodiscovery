 >Neural connectomics has begun producing massive amounts of data,
  necessitating new analysis methods to discover the biological and
  computational structure. It has long been assumed that discovering
  neuron types and their relation to microcircuitry is crucial to
  understanding neural function. Here we developed a nonparametric
  Bayesian technique that identifies neuron types and microcircuitry
  patterns in connectomics data. It combines the information
  traditionally used by biologists in a principled and probabilistically-coherent manner, including  including connectivity, cell body
  location and the spatial distribution of synapses. We show that the
  approach recovers known neuron types in the retina and enables
  predictions of connectivity, better than simpler algorithms. It also
  can reveal interesting structure in the nervous system of
  C. elegans and a historic microprocessor.
  Our approach extracts structural meaning from
  connectomics, enabling new approaches of automatically deriving
  anatomical insights from these emerging datasets.
