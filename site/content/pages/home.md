## Automatic discovery of cell types and microcircuitry from neural connectomics

[Eric Jonas](http://www.ericjonas.com) and [Konrad Kording](http://www.koerding.com/)



 >Neural connectomics has begun producing massive amounts of data,
  necessitating new analysis methods to discover the biological and
  computational structure. It has long been assumed that discovering
  neuron types and their relation to microcircuitry is crucial to
  understanding neural function. Here we developed a nonparametric
  Bayesian technique that identifies neuron types and microcircuitry
  patterns in connectomics data. It combines the information
  traditionally used by biologists in a principled and
  probabilistically-coherent manner, including including connectivity,
  cell body location and the spatial distribution of synapses. We show
  that the approach recovers known neuron types in the retina and
  enables predictions of connectivity, better than simpler
  algorithms. It also can reveal interesting structure in the nervous
  system of C. elegans and a historic microprocessor.  Our approach
  extracts structural meaning from connectomics, enabling new
  approaches of automatically deriving anatomical insights from these
  emerging datasets.
