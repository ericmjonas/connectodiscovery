Summary: Short version for index and feeds

* For those seeking a review of connectomics and cell types, [Neuron
recently had a special issue with many great reviews and
perspectives](http://www.cell.com/neuron/issue?pii=S0896-6273%2814%29X0018-8
) (and no, we're not saying this just because they cite us!)


* Our model is based on [Charles Kemp's Infinite Relational Model](
http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Kemp-etal-AAAI06.pdf ), a Bayesian
nonparametric extension of the stochastic block model. Stochastic
block models assume that each cell (or entity) has a single type, and
those types heavily influence the resulting connectivty patterns.

* ["Discovering Latent Classes in Relational
Data"](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/30489) is an excellent tech
report by Kemp, Griffiths, and Tenenbaum which motivates the analysis
and latent modeling of relational data.

* For an introduction to the Dirichlet Process prior that we are
using, section 2 of [Tom Griffith's introduction to the Indian Buffet
process is concise and
accessable](https://cocosci.berkeley.edu/tom/papers/indianbuffet.pdf)
A more detailed introduction can be found in [Kevin Murphy's excellent
"Machine Learning: A Probabilistic
Perspective"](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/ ) book. You should
read this book anyway, it will make you a better person.

* Inference via [Markov Chain Monte
  Carlo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) is a
  massive field unto itself, but both Murphy's book as well as [Chris
  Bishop's
  book](http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738
  ) have good introductions.
